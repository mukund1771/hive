        Purpose
            Apply a scoped, line-level modification to an existing file.

        When to use
            Update curated canonical memory
            Fix or refine existing summaries or facts
            Remove duplication or stale information

        Rules & Constraints
            Patch must be small and targeted
            Must preserve unrelated content
            Only allowed on approved files and sections

        Best practice
            Always read the file first. Never patch blindly.

        Args:
            path: The path to the file (relative to agent sandbox)
            patch_text: The patch text to apply
            agent_id: The ID of the agent

        Returns:
            Dict with application status and patch results, or error dict
